## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities through our contact form: https://www.dappros.com/contact-us/

In most cases, you will hear back to us within a few days, or up to two weeks.

We do not have any fixed bugs bounty policy at the moment. We do not offer bounty for minor or known issues that do not affect the product or users security in a significant way. At the same time we'll be happy to review every contribution on invididual terms.
