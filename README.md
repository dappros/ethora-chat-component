# Ethora Chat Component: a single npm for your React chat

## About Chat Component

Ethora Chat Component allows you to build a functioning chat room super quickly.
Sounds simple and is easy to build your app with.
Uses XMPP chat protocol and ejabberd chat server to provide your users with a seamless instant messaging experience. 

Once you need more functionality however you will be pleasantly surprised. Our Ethora platform behind the chat component offers a plethora of functionalities around chat/social, user profiles, digital wallets, business documents exchange, digital collectables, web3 and AI bots. The history behind Chat Component is following. First, we have built a low-code ‚Äúsuper app‚Äù engine called Ethora: https://github.com/dappros/ethora/ which we used to drastically speed up app development for our clients. Afterwards, we have open-sourced it for the benefit of other developers. Later on, we realized that whilst developers love what Ethora can do, many of them don‚Äôt need such a complex engine with all bells and whistles but a steep learning curver. In most cases you‚Äôre after a certain functionality (like a simple chat room) and you need it quick.

Enter Ethora Chat Component which allows you to quickly implement your chat room experience!

If / once you need additional functionalities you will have options like: (a) build them yourself on top of chat component; (b) peek into or use code from Ethora open-source monorepo https://github.com/dappros/ethora/ or (c) seek help from Ethora team or other developers at our forum: https://forum.ethora.com/ or Discord server: https://discord.gg/Sm6bAHA3ZC

## How to build your chat room in 5 minutes

1. npm create vite@latest
2. specify a name for your project (e.g. "vite-project") 
3. select framework and variant (for example, React -> Typescript but may be different depending on your project requirements, it will work with plain Javascript too)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20b732d3-482d-4538-bb03-359a9beb8a51" width="500" />

4. cd vite-project _(use your name instead of "vite-project")_
5. npm i
6. npm i @ethora/chat-component
7. go to file src/App.tsx and replace it with the below code

```
import { Chat } from "@ethora/chat-component";
import "./App.css";

function App() {
 return (
   <Chat />
 );
}

export default App;
```

7. run like this
```
npm run dev
```

you should see something like this:

8. Open http://localhost:5173/ in your browser

Voil√† - your chat app should work like so:

‚ÑπÔ∏è Note: your Ethora App, User and Chat credentials are hard-coded and login screen is bypassed. This is done so that you can scaffold and test the functionality quickly.
Leave this as is if you only need to demo or validate the chat functionality as part of your project.
If you need to have your own private chats, be able to login multiple users etc then go to https://www.ethora.com/, sign up in the top right which gives you a free account with Ethora backend where you can create your own App, manage your Users and Chats, view stats etc. Copy App ID & App Secret to your chat component code which will then switch to your own App context on the server side. The free tier is generous but should you need extra you can later build your own backend, upgrade to a paid tier from Ethora or use a self-hosted AWS marketplace image from Ethora. 



## Extra options (styling etc)

To create custom chat room styles in **App.tsx**:

replace 
```
<Chat />
```

with:

```
<Chat
    config={{
      disableHeader: true,
      disableMedia: true,
      colors: { primary: "#4287f5", secondary: "#42f5e9" },
    }}
    MainComponentStyles={{
      width: "100%",
      height: "500px",
      borderRadius: "16px",
      border: "1px solid #42f5e9",
    }}
  />
```

For styling you can alter **App.css**:

```
#root {
 width: 100%;
 margin: 0 auto;
 text-align: center;
}
```

and **index.css**:

```
body {
 margin: 0;
 display: flex;
 place-items: center;
 min-width: 320px;
 min-height: 100vh;
 width: 100%;
}
```

After these changes you can modify **MainComponentStyles** for your chat.

* **E-mail + password** ‚úÖ
